# Data-Wrangling-Project

Added Package `DiseaseDivas`. Simply Build and Run in RStudio (`Ctrl + Shift + B`). Use the libarary using library("DiseaseDivas")

Contains two functions: `remove.nulls` and `carbon.copy` which removes the columns with all `NA` values and same elements respectively. Will add another function later. Commented out sample dataframe to test it out! Feel free to use it.
